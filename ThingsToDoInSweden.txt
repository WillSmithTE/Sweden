Things To Do
- Ferry out to the archipelago and camp the night out there (no campsite required just camp where you want). I recommend Grinda
- Go to the Hornstull flea markets
- Swim at Hornstull beach
- Go for a sunset/anytime picnic up on Skinnarviksberget (view over Stockholm)
- Go up the Stadshuset (town hall)
- Walk around Mariatorget (2nd hand shopping is nice here)
- Get a Fika (kanelbullar and coffee) in Mariatorget 
- Explore Gamla Stan (old town)
- Eat out by the Evert Taubes Terass (in Gamla Stan, just a nice place to take a picnic)
- Watch a hockey game at the Globe (don't know if they're running through summer..)
- Walk around from Gamla Stan over the bridge to Kungstradgarden and along the water up to the bridge to Djurgarden/Skansen area
- Walk around Djurgarden/Skansen (apparently the zoo and Vasamuseet are nice but I haven't been)
- Have a fika on HMS af Chapman/explore the Skeppsholmen area
- "Bush"walk and swim in Tyresta national park
- Alternative to Tyresta walk is a walk around Galo (basically the same, or you could do both because both are beautiful)

Food/Drink places
- Bageri Petrus (in Mariatorget) for fika
- Cafe Dox for fika 
- Hermans - delicious vegan buffet with views over Stockholm
- Ugglan - games bar with board games, ping pong, nice beer
- Trattorian (about the only restaurant I went to, quite nice Italian food and on the water but not a must-do)


Go to Gamla Stan for looking at the old buildings/pretty stuff, and the southern area (get off a Slussen and explore) Sodermalm for the cool bars and cafes. The best part of Stockholm is how easy it is to walk around on big footpaths. They also have great bike paths and pretty cheap bike hire, there was one we did which was something like 270 krona for 3 days with City Bikes. They have bike racks throughout the city so you just put them down and can pick them up or new ones as you like for the 3 days.
